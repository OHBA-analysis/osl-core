%SIMULATE_MEG_SIGNAL calculates a simulated signal in MEG sensors
%
% [SIMDATA, SIG] = SIMULATE_MEG_SINGAL(...) [all inputs required; not listed]
%    returns the signal in sensors, SIMDATA, based on a set of dipoles with
%    defined orientations and a set of leadfields for a brain mesh. The
%    signals input at each dipole location are returned in SIG. 
%
%    If more than one trial is specified, SIMDATA will hold each trial in a
%    separate cell. 
% 
%    White noise is added for each trial, determined by the supplied SNR or
%    a johnson shot noise amplitude and bandwidth
%    
%    Structured noise can be added if the covariance matrix is provided
%    (e.g. from measurements in an empty room) and an SNR
