% Problem:  Calls to ft_multiplotER were producing an error in calling the mex file spm12/external/fieldtrip/utilities/private/mxSerialize

% Solution: inserted all fieldtrip/utilities/private/*.mexmaci64 files from spm12b (beta) 

osl2.0/spm12/external/fieldtrip/utilities/private/*.mexmaci64

% Update: This fix did not work me (Adam) and should therefore not be in place as a general solution. Instead I would recommend reinstalling SPM12 and recompiling the fieldtrip mex files using ft_compile_mex(true). This eventually worked for me without having to copy any SPM12b files. The original solution has been removed.

% Problem: Fieldtrip's implementation of local spheres does not correctly map coils to channels when tra matrix is modified. This was previously solved by reloading the raw tra matrix prior to running the forward model, but this was not robust to splitting the coregistration and forward model stages, since the sensor information is saved into D.inv during coregistration, and was an somewhat cumbersome hack.

% Solution: save new field coilchan in D.sensors('MEG') in osl_convert_script.m (which will in turn be a field in grad in ft_headmodel_localspheres). Modified ft_headmodel_localspheres.m to use this field instead of grad.tra if present.

% Problem: badsamples.m has been updated on the SPM12 SVN, this change may not have been updated.

% Solution: copy local copy to the SPM12 directory

% Problem: Fieldtrip undoes TOG corrections on CTF data during source recon and data conversion

% Solution: replace undobalancing.m with a file which takes no action, but issues an informative warning.

% Solution: copy local correct copy to the SPM12 directory via spm-changes
