   This software builds heavily on contributions by Mark Schmidt
   (L1precisionBCD) and Hao Wang (glasso_FTH), including significant code 
   snippets. See references:

   Neither code package was released with a license, beyond author
   acknowledgment. 

   Some small functions from Tom Minka's open-source LIGHTSPEED Matlab 
   toolbox are copied across. If you don't have this toolbox, try it out.
   Also included is the logdet function from Dahua Lin at MIT, freely 
   available. 

   If you use Adrian Willis' QPAS package to offer speed increases in the 
   regularization functions, he asks that you cite his work.
