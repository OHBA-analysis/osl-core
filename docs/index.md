The OHBA Software Library (OSL) is created by the OHBA Analysis Group, OHBA, Oxford, UK.

OSL is a set of Matlab tools and scripts for running M/EEG analysis on CTF and Elekta Neuromag data, and is written mainly by members of the OHBA Analysis Group. It uses a combination of FSL, SPM and Fieldtrip.

The Github repository is insufficient to run OSL, as it requires a bunch of supporting directories. These can be downloaded from the OSL wiki. To get access to this please email [mark.woolrich@ohba.ox.ac.uk](mailto:mark.woolrich@ohba.ox.ac.uk)
