title('Envelope correlation after leakage correction and downsampling to 1Hz')

%%
% Note how the correlations become stronger as the sampling frequency is reduced.
% The extent to which you can downsample your data depends on the quantity of 
% data. Because the recording is only 45 seconds long, downsampling to 1Hz means that the
% correlation is computed using only 45 samples, which is not enough to robustly estimate
% connectivity.
%
% A procedure for quantitatively estimating the optimal sampling rate is provided in
% Luckhoo et al. (2012). As a point of comparison, we would typically use a sampling 
% rate of 1Hz for resting state recordings around 500s in length.
