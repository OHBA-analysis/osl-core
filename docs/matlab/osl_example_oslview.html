%% Utilities - oslview
%
% OSLview is a tool for viewing continuous MEG data. Additionally, it allows
% interactive flagging of bad channels and time periods in format that is
% compatible with the OAT pipeline. OSLview may be run in Matlab by calling
% oslview(D) where D is an SPM MEEG object containing the continuous data.

D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','roinets_example','subject_1'));
D = oslview(D);

%%
% <<oslview_main.png>>
%
%% Basic display
%
% OSLview displays a time window of data from all channels for a particular
% sensor type. You can choose the sensor type from the 'Channels' menu. From
% left to right, the buttons on the top of the window are
% 
% # Increase time window (x-axis limits)
% # Decrease time window
% # Activate vertical zoom (drag mouse vertically in main window to zoom in,
%   right click to zoom out)
% # Increase signal amplitude
% # Decrease signal amplitude
%
% *Summary Statistics*
%
% In addition to displaying the data in the main window, OSLview also displays
% summary statistics of the data in the Pan Window and Side Window. The Side
% Window shows the variance of each channel over all time points (right clicking
% this window brings up a context menu that allows this to be changed to
% kurtosis). The Pan Window shows the variance over all channels at each time
% point. These two displays are useful for identifying time points or channels
% with abnormally high variance that may be indicative of an artefact.

%% Flagging Bad Channels
%
% OSLview can be used to flag channels or sections of the data, such that they
% may be excluded from subsequent analyses. A channel may be flagged as bad by
% right-clicking on the trace for that channel in the main window, or by
% right-clicking on the bar for the channel in the side window. The selected
% channel is highlighted and a context menu with the channel label will
% appear. Select "Set Channel as Bad" to flag this channel. The selected
% channel is now flagged as bad and is shown as a dashed trace. The Pan Window
% and Side Window should update since the variance statistics are recalculated
% with this channel removed.
%
% Bad channels can be reverted to good by right clicking and selecting "Set
% Channel as Good" from the context menu.
%
% Bad channels are assigned to the SPM MEEG object using the badchannel method. 

%% Flagging Bad Segments
%
% To flag a section of data as bad, (e.g. to exclude an artefact), first right
% click in the Main Window at a time point corresponding to the start of the
% section you wish to exclude. From the context menu, select "Mark Event" to
% define the start of this bad section.
%
% The start of the bad section is shown as a green line in the Main Window and
% in the Pan Window. The end of the section is defined by repeating this process
% at a time point corresponding to the end of the section.
%
% The end of the section is shown as a red line in the Main Window and in the
% Pan Window. Once the end section has been defined, the data is flagged as bad
% and the The Pan Window and Side Window will update to reflect the change in
% the variance statistics after recalculating with this section removed.
%
% <<oslview_badsegment.png>>
%
% A section marked as bad may be made good again by right clicking within the
% section (between the green and red lines). The context menu will provide the
% option "Remove Event". Selecting this will unflag this section and the green
% and red lines will disappear.
%
% Bad sections are saved to the SPM MEEG object as events of type "BadEpoch"
% using the events method.

%% Saving output
%
% Changes to the MEEG object are performed in memory, and the modified MEEG
% object is returned when you close the |oslview| window. However, the changes
% are not automatically written to disk until you call |D.save()|.
