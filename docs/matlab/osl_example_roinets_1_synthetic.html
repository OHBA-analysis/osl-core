%% ROInets 1 - Introduction to orthogonalization
%
% This example uses synthetic signals to illustrate the effect of orthogonalization.
%
%%
% Spatial leakage in the beamformer results in correlations between adjacent/nearby voxels being
% introduced, that are not the result of correlations in neural activity. As an approximation, this
% can be corrected for by removing all zero-lag correlations. Note that this does not eliminate correlations
% in the amplitude envelopes (although it does decrease them somewhat). By doing this, the remaining
% correlation is assumed to reflect genuine functional connectivity. 
% 
% To demonstrate orthogonalization in practice, this example illustrates the use of the low-level
% |ROInets| function |remove_source_leakage()| which implements the core orthogonalization algorithms.
%
% First, we generate a synthetic signal and plot it
Fs       = 100; %Hz
duration = 60; %s
time     = 0:1.0/Fs:duration;
nSamples = length(time);
b        = fir1(1024, 0.5);
nVoxels  = 3;
[ARfilterTerms, ARnoiseVar] = lpc(b, 7); 
% Generate data from a covariance matrix and smooth
C    = [1  -0.1 0.6
       -0.1   1 0.3
        0.6 0.3   1] * ARnoiseVar;
u    = chol(C)' * randn(nVoxels, nSamples);
data = filter(1, ARfilterTerms, u.').';
figure('Name', 'Input data', 'Color', 'w');
plot(time.', data.');
xlabel('Time')
ylabel('Signal value')
%%
% Our signal has 3 'voxels' and we will assign each to its own 'parcel'
spatialBasis = eye(3);

%% 
% Notice that the signal has correlations between channels
corr(data')

%%
% The |remove_source_leakage()| function takes in the data matrix, as well as the orthogonalization
% method. To apply symmetric orthogonalization, we can simply call:
data_orthog = ROInets.remove_source_leakage(data, 'symmetric');

%%
% Now, the channels have no static zero-lag correlation
corr(data_orthog')

%%
% However, the amplitude of the orthogonalized signals is quite different to the original signals
std(data')
std(data_orthog')

%%
% The 'closest' orthogonalization method also results in orthogonal signals, but iteratively 
% rotates and scales the basis vectors to best preserve the original signals. As a result, 
% the orthogonalized signals are still uncorrelated, but their amplitudes much better match the
% original signals
data_orthog_closest = ROInets.remove_source_leakage(data, 'closest');
corr(data_orthog_closest')
std(data_orthog_closest')

%% EXERCISES
% 1. Have a closer look at the outcome of the orthogonalisation procedures
% using simple superimposed plotting or compute correlations between the
% different orthogonalization. 
%
% 2. Also, try to model a situation where one parcel gets a lot of signal from
% another one (due to a bad parcellation, for example). This can be modeled
% by increasing the correlation between e.g. parcel 1 and 3 as defined by
% the matrix multiplied in variable C (i.e. change both values of 0.6 to 0.9, for
% example). Check the outcome of the orthogonalization. Have a look at how
% much the orthogonalization changes the original signal (by simply
% plotting over each other or by calculating the correlation coefficient).
% What happens with the similarity between the original and the 'closest'
% orthogonalisation if there is this elevated mixing of signals in comparison to
% the example in the practical?
% 
% 3. Why would someone want to use 'symmetric' over 'closest' orthogonalization
% if it matches the original time-series so much better in terms of
% amplitude? Increase the dimensionality and/ or length of fthe time
% courses? and compare runtimes. Also, check how these two time-series
% compare (correlation or simple visual inspection).
