%% Estimate a whole-brain HMM model with GLEAN

% This example shows how to use the HMM to infer transient states 
% in whole-brain resting state MEG data, such that the states reflect 
% distinct, recurrent patterns of power
% and functional connectivity (in terms of power correlation).
% For this, we will use GLEAN, a tool offering a wrap of functionalities 
% and internally using the HMM-MAR toolbox (which will be covered in the next practical)
% for the final estimation.
% GLEAN does a number of things for us before calling to the HMM-MAR:
%
% 1.- Bandpass-filtering: we would be discarding very slow and very fast frequencies, 
%   although we also could use it to focus on a particular band of interest. 
%
% 2.- Getting power time courses: using the Hilbert transform we will get rid of the phase,
%   information, producing time series that reflect only the changes on power. 
%
% 3.- Subsampling: because power changes are slow, we can afford subsampling the data to reduce
%   the computational load without losing statistical power on the estimation. 
%
% 4.- Applying a parcellation: mapping the data (deployed on a regular grid of 3D points)
%   onto a number of time series, each corresponding to a different brain region (uses ROInets).
%
% 5.- Leakage correction: because of the artefactual high correlation between proximal regions,
%   we orthogonalise the data such that the remaining connectivity is genuine (uses ROInets).

% courses and the envelope data at each voxel. These maps may be output

% This results field contains the settings, as well as pointers to the spatial maps in
