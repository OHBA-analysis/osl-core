function [O, Q, R] = householder_orthogonalise(A)
%HOUSEHOLDER_ORTHOGONALISE	orthogonalisation using householder method
% O = HOUSEHOLDER_ORTHOGONALISE(A) Computes orthogonal set of vectors O 
%    from input A. Vectors must form columns of A. 
%
% [O, Q, R] = HOUSEHOLDER_ORTHOGONALISE(A) Computes orthonormal vectors
%    in Q and R such that A = Q*R.
