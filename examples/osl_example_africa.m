%% Preproc - AFRICA (ICA artefact removal)
%
% OSL provides a framework for employing Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
% to remove certain artefacts from MEG data. Using this framework, sources of
% interference, such as eye-blinks, ECG and line noise, can be separated from
% the genuine MEG data and removed.
% 
% To use ICA denoising, you will use the function osl_africa.m. osl_africa can
% currently be applied to Elekta Neuromag and CTF data.
% 
% The de-noising process has three stages:
%
% *1. Decomposition of data into independent components.*
%
% * Here, the MEG data is extracted from the SPM object.
% * Each sensor type is normalised by its smallest eigenvalue.
% * Bad epochs (as defined by OSLview), bad trials and bad channels are
%   removed.
% * fastica is used to decompose the data into a set of independent time
%   courses and associated topographies.
% * The default parameters are recommended.
%
% *2. Classification of artefact components*
%
% * This stage will require user-input.
%
% *3. Subtraction of artefact components from data to yield denoised data.* 
%
% * This final stage is automated and should not require any user input.
% * The independent time courses are subtracted from the MEG data. This is
%   implemented via the spm_eeg_montage function which means that subsequent
%   leadfields will be corrected.
%
% To start, load an MEEG object

D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','preproc_example','manual','subject1_spm_meeg.mat'))

%%
% The main entry point is the function |osl_africa|. The first argument is the
% MEEG object, and then key-value pairs of options. The most important options
% to be aware of are
% 
% # |do_ica| - Perform the ICA decomposition (stage 1, time consuming)
% # |do_ident| - Classify ICA components and select bad channels
% # |do_remove| - Use the bad channels to write an online montage
% # |used_maxfilter| - If working with Elekta data, identify fewer components
% # |ident_func| - Select the identification function (more below)
%
% By default, all three stages will be run, and manual component selection
% will be used. As we are working with Elekta data , make sure that
% |used_maxfilter| is set. To run only the first stage, use

D = osl_africa(D,'do_ident',false,'do_remove',false,'used_maxfilter',true);

%%
% For the example data, this should take on the order of 2 minutes, depending
% on your computer. It could potentially be much longer depending on your
% data. *It is important that you remove bad segments from the data using
% |oslview()| prior to running |osl_africa()| as this will have a big effect
% on the inference of the components.*. A new field has been added to the MEEG
% object storing the results of the calculation

D.ica

%%
% In general, |osl_africa| makes changes in memory and returns an MEEG object
% that can optionally be saved, rather than writing changes to disk
% automatically. However, because ICA is potentially very time consuming,
% these results are automatically saved to disk. It's possible to end up in a
% confusing situation - for example

% D = spm_eeg_load(fname)
% D.ica % Error because field does not exist
% osl_africa(D) % ICA results saved to disk
% D.ica % Error because D has not been reloaded
% D = spm_eeg_load(fname)
% D.ica % Results work

%%
% To avoid this, make sure you use |D = osl_africa(D,...)| rather than
% |osl_africa(D,...)|.
%
% It is also worth remembering that the ICA algorithm is randomly initialized,
% which means that if you run it again, you might not get the same
% decomposition. To make your results reproducible, set the random number
% generator in Matlab (e.g. |rng(0)|) before running |osl_africa|.
%
% If ICA results are present, |osl_africa| will not rerun the ICA stage by
% default unless you set |do_ica| to |true|. To examine the components, we can
% thus use

D = osl_africa(D,'do_remove',false);

%%
% This opens the ICA component identification GUI. Often you will want to
% compare the ICA components to other sensor data such as EOG and EMG. You can
% specify which channels in the data you want to correlate the components
% with:

D = osl_africa(D,'do_remove',false,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'});

%%
% Mark a component as bad using the red cross button  toolbar, and then close
% the GUI. If you inspect D, you can see that the bad components have been
% marked in |D.ica.bad_components|. At the moment, there are no online
% montages. To remove these components via an online montage, use

has_montage(D);
D = osl_africa(D,'do_ident',false,'do_remove',true);

%%
% This will run the removal step and make an online montage with the bad
% components removed.

has_montage(D);

%%
% Remember that these are only in memory, and you need to use |D.save()| to
% write the changes to disk. Normally you would run both the identification
% and the component removal in a single step, using

% D = osl_africa(D)

%%
% Note that this will result in two online montages

% has_montage(D)

%%
% It can be helpful to delete any unwanted montages prior
% to using |osl_africa| e.g.

% D = D.montage('remove',1) % Remove the first montage
% has_montage(D)


%% Automatic component removal
%
% Set the |ident_func| option to use automatic artefact removal

D_automatic = osl_africa(D,'used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'},'ident_func',@identify_artefactual_components_auto)

%%
% This will automatically assign the bad components. If you redo the manual
% artefact selection, you can make changes to the assignment if you like.
D_touchup = osl_africa(D_automatic,'used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'});

%%
% You can set the |ident_params| option to a struct that gets passed to the
% identification function. For example, you can enable mains and kurtosis
% artefact rejection, and extra plotting
%
% D_extra = osl_africa(D,'used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'},'ident_func',@identify_artefactual_components_auto,'ident_params',struct('do_mains',true,'do_kurt',true,'do_plots',true));
%
%% Description of method in publications
%
% Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to decompose the sensor data for
% each session into 150 temporally independent components (tICs) and associated
% sensor topographies using FastICA (http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica).
% Artifact components were classified via the following procedure. Eye-blink,
% cardiac and mains interference components were manually identified by the
% combined inspection of the spatial topography, time course, kurtosis of the
% time course and frequency spectrum for all components. Eye-blink artifacts
% typically exhibited high kurtosis (>20), a repeated blink structure in the
% time course and very structured spatial topographies. Cardiac component time
% courses strongly resembled the typical ECG signals, as well as having high
% kurtosis (>20). Mains interference had extremely low kurtosis (typically <âˆ’1)
% and a frequency spectrum dominated by 50 Hz line noise. Artefacts were then
% rejected by subtracting them out of the data.
